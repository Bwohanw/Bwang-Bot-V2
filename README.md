# Bwang-Bot-V2
Bot for discord. This is V2 because the first bot I created as a music bot, but lost the source code when my old computer died. This one doesn't have music functionality, but I added a kanji quiz generator and a couple basic commands to start off with. Note: The key for the bot is private and locally stored in a .env folder. The same is said for KANJI_KEY, which is the key to access the kanji api that I used.
